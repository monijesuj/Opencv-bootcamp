## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or Jupyter Lab) for running the notebooks
- **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and other relevant Python libraries

## Setup & Usage
1. **Notebooks:**  
   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and launch Jupyter:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Scripts:**  
   To run the image display script, execute:
   ```sh
   python scripts/display_image.py
   ```
3. **Images:**  
   All image assets required for the bootcamp are located in the `images/` folder. Ensure that any relative paths in the notebooks or scripts are adjusted accordingly.

## Additional Information
- Each notebook is organized to walk you through different aspects of OpenCV image processing.
- Inline comments within the code explain the operations and functions being carried out.
- For contributions or further clarifications, please refer to the comments in the source code.

Happy Exploring!
